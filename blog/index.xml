      <description>Its been difficult to search torrents in the web these days. So, I planned to create a torrent searching script using python. First of all, we need asource to scrap the torrents.
I use the following torrent websites:
 The Pirate Bay snowfl Skytorrents  Review The Pirate Bay proxies are banned pretty quickly. So, its waste to use them.
Snowfl is great since that website itself scraps torrents from tpb and 1337x etc&amp;hellip; But there is no way to provide search arguments in the url.</description>

      <description>Hello people, For the past month, I have been thinking about starting a blog. I wanted to have full customization. So, I didn&amp;rsquo;t chose wordpress or blogger or any other corporate website creator. Remaining option is Static Site Generator. I searched for the best SSG. I seen Jekyll. But, Hugo seems to have more customization like JSON output,RSS feed etc. Which are needed because I planned to create an app for this blog.</description>
