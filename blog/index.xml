Social Network Most of you guys put everything in social network. Thats not a good practice. You are giving every information to a stalker.</description>

      <description>Hello people, For the past month, I have been thinking about starting a blog. I wanted to have full customization. So, I didn&amp;rsquo;t chose wordpress or blogger or any other corporate website creator. Remaining option is Static Site Generator. I searched for the best SSG. I seen Jekyll. But, Hugo seems to have more customization like JSON output,RSS feed etc. Which are needed because I planned to create an app for this blog.</description>
