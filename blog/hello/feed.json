    "content" : "<p>Hello people,
    For the past month, I have been thinking about starting a blog.
I wanted to have full customization. So, I didn&rsquo;t chose wordpress or blogger or any other corporate website creator.
Remaining option is Static Site Generator. I searched for the best SSG.
I seen <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jekyll</a>. But,
<a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Hugo</a> seems to have more customization like JSON output,RSS feed etc.
Which are needed because I planned to create an app for this blog.
So, lets start this wonderful Journey.
And thanks <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gitlab</a> for providing hosting free for this blog.
